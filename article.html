                <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
                <p>Neural networks have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in recent years, with larger models showing increasingly sophisticated behavior. This article examines the relationship between model scale and capabilities, exploring the implications for future AI development.</p>

                <h2>2. Understanding Scale</h2>
                <p>The relationship between model size and capability is not merely linear. As models grow larger, they often exhibit qualitatively different behaviors, suggesting emergent properties that arise from scale itself.</p>
